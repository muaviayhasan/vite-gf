                Glass and Fusion were recommended to me by a friend who had used
                them in the past for a splashback with great success. From my
                original visit to their showroom, I was dealt with in a friendly
                yet professional manner which inspired confidence. Their fitter
                came to my property to template the job and found that the walls
                were not as flat as they could be! Also, a water pipe ran up to
                the flat above mine in the corner of my kitchen which proved to
                be another problem. Despite this, the end result is simply
                fantastic. The installation was carried out with precision and
                lack of mess and I would have no hesitation in recommending them
                wholeheartedly. Many thanks to all at Glass and fusion.

                Abdel Fliti of Glass & Fusion and his superb team were
                responsible for what can only be described as my best contractor
                interaction on what has been for me, an 11 month home
                redevelopment. Slick, professional, creative and utter experts
                at what they do, they are responsible for giving me a luxury
                worktop and splashback finish to an otherwise standard kitchen I
                installed. Super caloborative with a eye for design and finish,
                they deserve high praise and complete recommendation. With a
                can-do attitude, skilled fitters and an impressive selection of
                marble and quartz colours and finishes, amongst other choice
                materials, they are an asset to any design project you may be
                working on. Such is my confidence, they are already contracted
                to work on my next two projects. Glass & Fusion - I thank you!

                From the time I walked into the showroom right until the end
                this company has been nothing but professional and has given
                exceptional customer service. I would highly recommend them and
                will definitely use them again. I am so pleased that amongst all
                the companies I had to quote me I chose Glass & Fusion Ltd.

                Fantastic quality, workmanship, service and price. I was
                recommended Abdel, so glad I did. I visited their showroom in
                Hayes and the choice was vast in terms of choice of materials
                and colours - I ended up going for quartz for our kitchen and
                utility room. Abdel was also very knowledgeable and made some
                good suggestions. Two guys came to fit it, having previously
                come to measure and they were equally brilliant. Saved me a lot
                of money over our contractors suggestions.

                <br />I have been using Glass Fusion for several years now,
                supplying me made to measure worktops and bespoke items to my
                interior design clients. They gave us hands-on advice right from
                the consultation stage saving us struggles during designing &
                fitting process. Experienced staff and did fantastic job and
                everytime.
