                Templating or measuring is one of our services and it is a key
                stage while processing your order.
                <br />
                <br />
                Upon site survey or templating, we will be discussing all
                requirements for your worksurface while the final product will
                be manufactured accordingly. Our surveyor will not only take
                measurements instead will highlight all aspect of job with you
                in terms of safety, support, cut positions, edge, colour
                confirmation, practical advice and practise, overhangs, angles
                and other requirements. Our main product is stone kitchen
                worktop and we produce templates, laser measuring and site
                survey for no obligation quote.
                <br />
                <br />
                Granite, Quartz & ceramic kitchen worktops measuring will take
                about an hour depends on the kitchen sizes. Our templating
                service not limited to worktops, we survey for marble stairs,
                marble vanity tops, wet-room cladding, stone fireplaces, onyx
                counters, bath surround, stone dining tables and barbeque
                granite worktops. Ultimately, we can bespoke our stone
                fabrication tailored to your project requirements.
                <br />
                <br />
                We mainly cover London and its surrounding counties however our
                dedicated team can travel further subject to job size.
                <br />
                <br />
                We have procedures in place for made to measure kitchen worktops
                and stone worksurfaces ranging from quotation upon fitting. Upon
                quotation we will generate digital drawing for the stone
                worktops highlighting their lengths and possible joint location.

                <b>Corex Sheets templating:</b>
                <br />
                Corex sheet templating will form replica for your stone kitchen
                worktop, shaped to the desired area with highlight to cut
                positions, overhangs, corners …etc. It will help to visualise
                the worktop before committing to final layout. Most of stone
                worktop attached appliances have no digital drawing which make
                it more practical to take template by plastic corex sheets.

                <b>Laser measuring:</b>
                <br />
                Most of ultra-compact counters and worktops will be measured by
                laser templating device to be processed though our CNC machines
                and this service also available to all fabricated countertops
                depends on the complexity of the job.

                All templates and measuring goes into thorough examination
                before go into production, selected pictures above as example:
                the surveyor generate two layouts for fabrications, one drawing
                is being used for accurately checking the requirements and its
                details while the second worktop laser measurements downloaded
                to machine software for cutting. Quality control documents will
                be circulated with the worktop as it travels from one stage to
                another upon worktop fabrication.

                <b>Template Checklist:</b>
                <br />- Support & safety: Kitchen cabinet and units should be
                secured and levelled. Firm & rigid structure supporting the
                weight of the stone worktop.
                <br />- Appliances: We need to make cut for all appliances
                connected to the worktops such sinks/hobs/pop-up sockets,
                supporting legs …etc. Those appliances need to be onsite to
                check against worktop requirements and to precisely measure cut
                position and shape.
                <br />- Joint & worktop layout: Project manager should be onsite
                to further discuss joint locations and final layout with our
                surveyors
                <br />- Overhang & corners: Handless cabinet doors have less
                worktop overhung while kitchen unit with handled doors will have
                larger worktop overhangs. Most of exposed kitchen worktop
                corners will be rounded and it will be discussed onsite with
                surveyors.
                <br />- Access: It is crucial to have clear access. Access to
                flats where there is flight of stairs can affect the length of
                the worktops.
