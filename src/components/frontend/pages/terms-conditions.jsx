                  <strong>4-</strong> Walls need to be plastered and squared but
                  do not necessarily have to be tiled. Please advise the
                  templator what you are intending to put on the walls.
                  Obviously if your walls are not straight or flat this may
                  affect the fitting of any upstands and splash backs. (See
                  point 7 below for additional information on sealing to other
                  surfaces)

                  splash backs or worktop, please advise the surveyor
                  accordingly. Electric points should be fixed or marked at the
                  height you want them. (We recommend allowing a minimum gap of
                  150mm from the base unit to the electric socket on 30mm
                  worktops).

                  advise our templator of any access, parking or other
                  restrictions to the property and whether you can supply the
                  fitters with temporary parking permits on fitting day. If the
                  room is up/downstairs the templator may wish to measure the
                  route to ensure there are no access issues on the day, please
                  allow the templator to visit all required areas. For Health
                  and Safety reasons our installers cannot remove their shoes or
                  cover them.

                  Obviously if your cupboards are not level to begin with your
                  worktops will not be level either.

                  <strong>1-</strong> Any existing worktops &ndash; temporary or
                  old &ndash; and any old tiling needs to have been removed. All
                  sinks, taps, hobs and any other appliances should be on site.
                  If you are planning to re-use your existing sink and hob or
                  any other fitted appliances it is your responsibility to check
                  with your own builder/plumber that they can be easily removed
                  and re-fitted without any damage &amp; they're ready for
                  installation on fitting day.

                  <strong>2-</strong> Our fitters do not undertake plumbing or
                  electrical works and are not certified for this type of work.
                  Please call the office before work commences if you need
                  assistance.

                  worktop are removed and drawers have been removed and
                  cupboards are empty &ndash; the fitters will need to fix the
                  tops from inside the cupboards. This will also ensure there
                  can be no damage to these items during installation.

                  <strong>4-</strong> <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Your base
                  carcass units must be fit-for-purpose and strong enough to
                  support the worktops. Some flat-pack kitchen units are only
                  designed to hold Formica or composite worktops so supporting
                  batons along the back wall and between large span may
                  therefore be required, especially over and/or behind
                  appliances - dishwashers, washing machines, tumble driers,
                  sinks, hobs and any other weak points. This would be exactly
                  the same advice for any solid worktops.

                  strengthening work necessary but if he could not see behind
                  your existing cupboards or appliances you must ask your
                  builder to check this.

                  fitters only fit worktops. They do not seal to other surfaces.
                  It is the responsibility of your decorator to finish behind
                  upstands/Splashback/etc... with caulk or filler to your
                  preference. Please ask the fitters if you have any questions
                  or would like to have them seal to other surfaces as part of
                  the fit (a charge maybe payable for this).
